Offline SMS Spam/Ham Detection (Streamlit + Local LLM) A privacy-focused AI SMS Spam/Ham Detection system built using Streamlit and a locally hosted LLM (Ollama + Phi-3). This project classifies any text message into HAM (normal) or SPAM (scam/promotional) — completely offline, with zero cloud usage.

3.	The LLM returns a single label: HAM or SPAM.
4.	Streamlit displays the result in a chat interface.

📝 Prompt Logic (Summary) The LLM is guided with: • Definitions of SPAM vs HAM • 10 labeled real SMS examples • Strict instruction to output only "HAM" or "SPAM" This ensures consistent and accurate classification.
